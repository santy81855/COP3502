    // c) using a loop, scan each name and place it into "names", making sure to allocate only enough space to store the name before using strcpy().
    // d) You can use strlen() to see the length of any string, but remember to leave enough space for the null terminator when you allocate
    // e) Then print out the list of names
    // f) And lastly, free all of the memory you have used before the program ends
